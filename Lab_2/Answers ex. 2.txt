1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase? 
	The model learns better patterns, so accuracy usually increases. But when too many nodes are used, accuracy is dropped due to overfitting.

2. Can you explain the pattern of accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
	Accuracy first increases as hidden nodes increase, after a significant number of hidden nodes , accuracy decreases due to too many nodes cause overfitting.
